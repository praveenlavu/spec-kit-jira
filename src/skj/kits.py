"""Kit digests and `skj kits verify` (local, read-only): which Spec Kit extensions are installed, what a human pinned in
`skj.kits.lock.json`, and whether the kit's files and the agent copies Spec Kit registered still match. Everything read from the repo
(the `.registry`, kit files, agent copies, the lockfile) is hostile: no symlink is followed, reads are confined and capped, a path with a
control character is refused before any hashing, and errors and findings are fixed texts that carry no kit text. Process enforcement,
not a security boundary: a local digest says "unchanged since a human looked", not "safe".
Git runs get `config.git_env()` (no inherited selector, no credential), a timeout and an output cap; `dir_digest_at` reads git objects
only (the commit CI judges), never the working tree. Which lockfile judges in CI is `lock_for`: the target branch's, never the PR's."""
